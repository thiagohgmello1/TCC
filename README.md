# TCC
Programs developed to complete my graduation
This repository contains all my programs used to model wireless power transfer systems with magnetic resonant coupling.
Some programs model systems with two coils (one transmiter and one receptor), others model systems with six coils, including drive coils.
The files MLateral and Lself calculate the mutual and self inductance.
Self inductance uses the Nagaoka coefficient.
Mutual inductance uses a numeric approach.
All progams use circuit model.
The last program (TCC17) represent an analitical approach to try to understand the circuit behaviour.
